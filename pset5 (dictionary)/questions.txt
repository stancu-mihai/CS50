0.  Is a lung disease also known as silicosis. It is also the longest word in the english language.
1.  It returns resource usage statistics
2.  It has 16 members.
3.  To take into account the run time required to get to the function call.
4.  The loop reads character by character from the file, until the end of file. 
Each character is appended to a word array until the word contains "\0" character (the word ends). 
For the words, only alphabetical characters are allowed. Words containing numbers are ignored.
A check is made to see whether the word was misspelled. If it is, it is printed.
5.  I think you used fgetc to allow us to use tries for storing. 
Also, fscanf reads chunks of data that need to be processed character by character anyway.
Furthermore, the length of the word is unknown at first, but kind of required for fscanf.
6.  They were declared as const as a safety measure (we don't want them to be modified by mistake) during the function.
7.  I have used a trie with each node containing a bool to test if we have a word and 26+1 pointer spaces.
8.  I have used trie structure from the beginning, so < 0.2s total
9.  None to improve performance, many to fix leaks
10. I am not aware of any bottlenecks.
