0.  GIF supports 8 bits per pixel. BMP, JPG, PNG support 24 bits per pixel.
1.  Only GIF format supports animation.
2.  Lossy compression - when uncompressing the file, only part of the information is there, and the file size is much reduced. Lossless compression - all information is available after uncompressing.
3.  JPG is lossy - compressed.
4.  The system modifies the first character of the file name to mark it as deleted, and adds that cluster to the free cluster list. The data is not deleted.
5.  Degauss the drive, or overwrite the data using special sanitization tools.
6.  stdint.h - Provides typedefs and macros for fixed-width integral types in accordance with the C99 standard (provides portability across platforms and compilers).
7.  uint_8t - unsigned int of 8 bits, uint32_t - unsigned int of 32 bits, int32_t - signed int of 32 bits, uint16_t - unsigned int of 16 bits (all cross platform)
    The point of using them is to have portability across platforms.
8.  BYTE - 1 byte, DWORD - 4 bytes,  LONG - 4 bytes, WORD - 2 bytes
9. First 2 bytes of bmp are the BITMAPFILEHEADER 
10. bisize - the number of bytes required by the structure, bfsize - the size, in bytes, of the info file
11. The bitmap is top-down if biHeight is negative
12. biBitCount-sets the color depth
13. copy.c's fopen might return NULL if the permission settings do not allow writing of that file.
14. The third parameter is always one because we want to read chunks of 1 byte.
15. padding=3 because 3x3 + padding (=3) = 12, which must be multiple of 4 bytes
16. fseek repositions a stream
17. SEEK_CUR - Parameter for the current file position (used by fseek)
